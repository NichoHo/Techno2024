                      For a beginner, C and Python are programming languages that can be used to understand the principles of programming algorithms easily. The C language is also used in the early stages of lectures by all SoCS majors in the Algorithm and Programming course, and the Python language is also used by SoCS Senayan students.

                      IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is an application software used to write code. A compiler is software that can convert source code or programming code into machine language so that it can be run by a computer.

                      Although many other IDEs and compilers can support C language programs (such as Visual Studio, Geany, and Clang). The Dev-C++ IDE and TDM-GCC compiler (which is installed by default on Dev-C++) are the IDEs used in learning sessions and practical exams, as determined by the BINUS University SLC (Software Laboratory Center).

                      To get access to the HIMTI KIT, BINUSIAN SoCS 2028 is registered to be present at the TECHNO 2024 main event from the start to the end of the event via the attendance form announced by the committee during the event. When HIMTI KIT can be accessed and how to access HIMTI KIT will be informed via the TECHNO 2024 participant LINE group. So that after the main event ends, it is hoped that participants will not leave the group first.
